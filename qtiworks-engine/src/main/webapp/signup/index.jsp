  <h2>Sign up</h2>

  <p>
    We are going to add a sign-up form to create your own QTIWorks account once we have
    a bit more of the system's functionality completed. Until then, if you would like an
    "early access" account and don't mind wearing a hard hat and goggles when using the system,
    please email <a href="http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/david-mckain">David McKain</a> to have
    an account created for you.
