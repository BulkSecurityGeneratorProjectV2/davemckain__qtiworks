The QTIWorks code is based on the earlier JQTI/QTIEngine and
MathAssessEngine tools.

The original JQTI/QTIEngine code was developed by Jiri Kajaba and
Jonathon Hare, working for the University of Southampton. The JQTI+
library in QTIWorks is derived from this original JQTI code and owes a
great debt of gratitude to this original work.

The remainder of the code in QTIWorks was largely developed by David
Mckain, working for the University of Edinburgh. This includes some bits
of MathAssessEngine, also largely developed by David McKain.

Contribution to the development of Java files has been indicated using
standard @author JavaDoc tags. I have tried where possible to attribute
everyone involved where possible.

This work has also benefited greatly from contributions and advice from
the many people, in particular Sue Milne, Niall Barr, Graham Smith,
Wilbert Kraan, Dick Bacon, Steve Lay, Zack Pierce, Jon Mason and Stephen
Vickers. (Sorry to anyone I've missed!)
